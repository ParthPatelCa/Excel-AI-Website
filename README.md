# Excel AI Insights

## AI-Powered Data Analysis for Excel and Google Sheets

This project provides an AI-powered web application that helps users get insights from their Excel files and Google Sheets. It features a Flask backend for data processing and AI integration, and a React frontend for a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV files for analysis.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Analyze data directly from publicly accessible Google Sheets URLs.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Get key findings, trends, data quality issues, and recommendations generated by AI.
- **Statistical Summary**: View basic statistical summaries of your data.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions about your data in plain English.
- **Formula Generation**: Get suggestions for Excel formulas based on your data.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `excel_ai_backend/`: Contains the Flask backend application.
- `excel-ai-frontend/`: Contains the React frontend application.

## Setup and Local Deployment

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or pnpm (pnpm is used in this guide)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (or extract the provided zip)

If you received a zip file, extract it to your desired location. If this were a GitHub repository, you would clone it:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd excel_ai_insights
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup (Flask)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd excel_ai_backend
    ```
2.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows (Command Prompt):
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On Windows (PowerShell):
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
4.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Set your OpenAI API Key:**
    The backend uses the OpenAI API for AI-powered insights. Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
        ```
    *   On Windows (Command Prompt):
        ```bash
        set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
        ```
    *   On Windows (PowerShell):
        ```powershell
        $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
        ```

### Step 3: Frontend Setup (React)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../excel-ai-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or npm install
    ```
3.  **Build the frontend for production:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    # or npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder inside `excel-ai-frontend` with the optimized production build.

### Step 4: Copy Frontend Build to Backend Static Folder

Navigate back to the root of your project and copy the built frontend files into the backend's static directory. This allows the Flask app to serve the React application.

```bash
cp -r excel-ai-frontend/dist/* excel_ai_backend/src/static/
```

### Step 5: Run the Full-Stack Application

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated** (from Step 2).
2.  **Navigate back to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd excel_ai_backend
    ```
3.  **Run the Flask backend server:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    The Flask server will start, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5001` (or `http://localhost:5001`). It will serve both the backend API and the React frontend.

### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001`.

## Google Sheets Integration Notes

For the Google Sheets integration to work, ensure any Google Sheet URLs you use are **publicly viewable** (shared with "Anyone with the link can view").

## Cloud Deployment

For cloud deployment, consider platforms like Heroku, Render, Google Cloud Run, or Vercel/Netlify (for frontend) combined with a backend service. Refer to the previous conversation for detailed options and recommendations.
