- **Integration examples** showing real-world usage

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   └── alerts.jsx          # Enhanced with all new components
│   ├── ChartBuilder.jsx        # Enhanced with toasts and loading
│   ├── DataCleaning.jsx        # Enhanced with validation and UX
│   └── UIShowcase.jsx          # New: Testing playground
├── hooks/
│   └── useToast.js             # New: Toast state management
└── App.jsx                     # Updated with UI Test tab
```

### Key Features:
- **Consistent Design Language**: All components follow the same design patterns
- **Accessibility First**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight animations, efficient re-renders
- **Mobile Responsive**: All components work seamlessly on mobile devices

## User Experience Improvements

### Before vs After:

#### Loading States:
- **Before:** Basic spinning icon
- **After:** Context-aware loading with progress indication

#### Error Handling:
- **Before:** Generic error messages in red boxes
- **After:** Toast notifications with actionable guidance

#### Data Processing:
- **Before:** Silent processing with no feedback
- **After:** Multi-stage visualization with clear progress

#### File Upload:
- **Before:** No validation feedback
- **After:** Instant validation with helpful error messages

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing Completed:
✅ All loading spinner variants render correctly
✅ Toast notifications appear and dismiss properly
✅ Skeleton loaders provide good visual feedback
✅ File validation works for various formats
✅ Error handling provides clear guidance
